      <h3>#1: Optimize Your Video SEO</h3>
      <p>
        When it comes to YouTube, the strength of your SEO strategy can make or
        break the success of your videos. Unlike social networks like Instagram
        and Facebook, YouTube is a search engine. In fact, it’s the world’s
        second-largest search engine after Google! So carefully considering your
        search keywords and optimizing your videos for them can help you to
        reach a much larger audience on the platform. The YouTube algorithm is
        very complex, with hundreds of indicators contributing to the SEO
        ranking of your videos.
      </p>
      <h3>#2: Add Closed Captions for Improved Ranking</h3>
      <p>
        It goes without saying that adding closed captions are a good idea for
        inclusivity and community building, but did you know they can also help
        with your SEO ranking?
      </p>
      <p>
        YouTube automatically adds subtitles to your video if you select a
        language during the upload process
      </p>
      <h3>#4: Create Eye-catching Thumbnails</h3>
      <p>
        As we covered earlier in the blog post, YouTube is a visual search
        engine. So with this in mind, an eye-catching thumbnail that teases the
        value of your content can make all the difference when it comes to your
        video’s view count.
