        Blade is the name of my pet dog. He has long, drooping ears with a mix
        of white & black fur on his body. He is of Pitbull breed. We bought him
        when he was just a month old. He has a cute face with shiny paws and
        eyes and has a tiny tail. He is a healthy dog with a shiny coat.

        Blade loves chasing monkeys and cats on a regular basis. he loves to
        play ball-fetch, running in the park and chasing squirrels. he loves to
        play and run around with his puppy friends too when he is out for a
        walk. he is a little possessive for his territory, family & friends. you
        have to be in his good books in order to be able to pet him ðŸ˜¹.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a famous influencer as well. 'Bladeboy007' is a well known name in
        the pet community of Instagram, especially dog network Instagram. Blade
        has a tight-knit circle of some of his neighborhood pets, and few
        intercontinental friends too. his reels have received massive
        appreciation in the last few months. he is the sole actor in the reels
        as of now but he is open for collaborations with other animals
        especially small dogs and white persian cats. DM him on instagram for
        collaboration related queries.
