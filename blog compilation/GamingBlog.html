        Gamers have known for a long time something that everyone else is
        starting to figure out: there’s community connection on the other side
        of a screen.

        “Our entire lives have led up to this,” my friends joked with me in
        mid-March. I was sitting in my tiny New York City apartment, panicky and
        coming to terms with the reality that I’d be trapped inside for weeks,
        potentially months. But my friends reassured me that as lifelong video
        game enthusiasts, the prospect of sitting on a sofa in front of a TV for
        an interminable stretch would be a cakewalk. After all, gamers like me
        do already spend plenty of time in front of our screens all on our own.
        But even sitting alone for hours, gamers aren’t necessarily isolated. In
        many cases, far from it. With the rise of social media, gamers –
        particularly in Gen Z – have perfected the art of building communities
        in and around video games. Gamers don’t just compete with strangers on
        the internet, but forge genuine, enduring friendships. In this age of
        long-haul social distancing and mental-health strains, gamers have long
        had a tool that’s now bringing some relief to those who’ve never picked
        up a controller before. The explosive growth of gaming during the
        pandemic has shown that many have found a new outlet for much-needed
        connection in isolation.

        Though video games are increasingly making their way into classrooms,
        scientists who study them say the data are lacking on whether they can
        actually improve learning — and most agree that teachers still
        outperform games in all but a few circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is growing evidence that some types of video games may improve
        brain performance on a narrow set of tasks. This is potentially good
        news for students, as well as for the millions of people who love to
        play, or at least can’t seem to stop playing (see infographic). “There
        is a lot of evidence that people — and not just young people — spend a
        lot of time playing games on their screens,” says Richard Mayer, an
        education psychology researcher at the University of California, Santa
        Barbara. “If we could turn that into something more productive, that
        would be a worthwhile thing to do.” In an article in the 2019 Annual
        Review of Psychology, Mayer set out to evaluate rigorous experiments
        that tested what people can learn from games. Though he’s not entirely
        convinced of games’ educational potential, some studies did suggest that
        games can be effective in teaching a second language, math and science.
        The hope, he says, is to figure out how to harness any brain-boosting
        potential for better classroom results.

      <h3>Your brain on games</h3>
      <p>
        Some of the first evidence that gaming may train the brain came from
        first-person shooter games. That these oft-maligned games might actually
        have benefits was first stumbled upon by an undergraduate studying
        psychology at the University of Rochester in New York. C. Shawn Green
        gave his friends a test of visual attention, and their scores were off
        the charts. He and his research supervisor, Daphné Bavelier, thought
        there must have been a bug in his coding of the test. But when Bavelier
        took the test, she scored in the normal range. The difference was that
        Green’s friends had all been devoting more than 10 hours per week to
        Team Fortress Classic, a first-person shooter version of capture the
        flag. Green and Bavelier then rigorously retested the idea with people
        who were new to gaming. They had two groups train on different types of
        games: One group practiced a first-person shooter action game for one
        hour per day for 10 days, and the other spent the same amount of time on
        Tetris, a spatial puzzle game. The new action gamers were significantly
        better at focusing on targets of interest in a cluttered, visually noisy
        field compared with the Tetris players. The team also found that the
        action gamers, on average, could consistently track five moving objects
        in a visual field, compared with the three that non-gamers could track.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bavelier, now a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of Geneva in
        Switzerland, says that action gamers are better able to switch their
        visual attention between distributed attention (scanning a large area
        for a particular object) and focused attention (extracting specific
        facts from a video). “This is called attentional control, the ability to
        flexibly switch attention as time demands,” she says. Though it’s not
        yet clear if improving this kind of attention can help kids in the
        classroom, Bavelier says, she does see the potential for games to help
        motivate students — adding a bit of “chocolate” to the learning mix.
        Green, now a cognitive psychologist at the University of
        Wisconsin–Madison, admits that the benefits of playing hours upon hours
        of Call of Duty may be limited in real life. “There are some people who
        have jobs with a need for enhanced visual attention,” he says, “such as
        surgeons, law enforcement or the military.” But, he notes, all games
        come with an opportunity cost. “If video game time displaces homework
        time, that can affect reading and math skills negatively.” In other
        studies, researchers found that gamers who trained on Tetris were better
        at mentally rotating two-dimensional shapes than those who played a
        control game. Students who played two hours of All You Can E.T., an
        educational game designed to enhance the executive function of switching
        between tasks, improved their focus-shifting skills compared with
        students who played a word search game. Not surprisingly, the cognitive
        skills that games can improve are the ones that players end up
        practicing over and over during the course of play.
      </p>
      <p>
        But importantly, these skill improvements are very specific to the task
        at hand: First-person shooter games don’t improve mental rotation of
        objects, and Tetris doesn’t improve visual attention. And ironically, in
        assessing studies for his review, Mayer found no convincing evidence
        that so-called brain-training games for healthy adults such as the
        Lumosity suite of games succeed at improving memory, attention or
        spatial cognition. The next step is to figure out how these findings may
        translate to the classroom, where video games are already making
        in-roads. Many students could benefit from an improvement in the ability
        to flexibly shift their attention when needed. And though first-person
        shooter games are not really appropriate for grade-school students,
        Bavelier says researchers are getting better at identifying the core
        features of video games that drive improved brain agility. “It could be
        a game based on a doctor who has to choose the right medicine to save
        the world. It doesn’t have to be linked to death, violence and zombies,”
        she says.
